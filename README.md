# CleanPerUserReceiverInstall

This script will work in conjunction with the Citrix Receiver Clean-up Utility to clean Receiever per-user installations for all users on a machine. The 'ReceiverCleanupUtility.exe' application can be downloaded from https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX137494 and needs to reside in the same directory as the script. The script should be run either as LocalSystem or an elevated local administrator.
